# SPARTA-benchmark

SPARTA stands for Speech Profiling for ARabic TAlk. The purpose of this project is to identify the speakerâ€™s gender, dialect, and emotion when speaking from a given utterance. 

This research profiles the speaker based on their voice. From a given speech, our model predicts gender, emotion, and dialect in real-time.

- Emotion [Sad, Happy, Angry, Surprise, Questioning, and Neutral].
- Gender [Male and Female] in the Arabic language (as many other languages).
- Dialect [Egypt, MSA, Levant, Gulf, North Africa].
